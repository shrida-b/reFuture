  <h3 class="header3"> So why plan? </h3>
  <p class="header3"> This plan includes suggestions on how easy it is to incorporate sustainability into our lives in just one week. Planning is a good way to keep track of these actions and encourage each user to reflect on their habits.</p>
  <p class="header3"> Planning is also a good way to help with time management and simply writing down what happens along your week allows you to sit down and take a mental break from life. Not only can making a green planner (whether it be on a notepad or recycled paper) take a positve toll on our planet, but it can positively impact our mental health too. Let's change our lives one day at a time! </p>
