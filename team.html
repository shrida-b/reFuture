        <p> Hey there! I’m Arietta, a rising sophomore at a high school in Orange County, CA. I am super passionate about coding; my coding accomplishments include founding the first coding club at my high school where I lead group projects, hackathons, etc. and winning the Invisalign ChangeMaker award as well as 1st place at OCSEF for my mental health app, Therabot (go download it in App Stores starting September 2021!). Through this project, I got to learn more about sustainability and have begun incorporating more eco-friendly practices into my life! I’m so excited that you are here to check out our website. Don’t hesitate to reach out @ ariettapc@gmail.com! </p>

        <p> Hey! My name is Shrida and I'm a rising junior at a highschool in the Bay Area. I've always been interested in coding, but I started last year with the Kode With Klossy Mobile Dev camp. Since then, that interest has grown into a passion of mine. I'm also really passionate about sustainability, and I'm glad that I've been able to combine both of my passions to create reFuture. I hope you'll be able to take the information provided on our website and implement some sustainable practices in your life! </p>

        <p> Hello my name is Catherine and I’m from Los Angeles. I’m a rising freshman in college and have recently been introduced to coding. I've always had an interest in coding but never knew where to start especially since my high school did not offer any computer science courses. This website was really fun to work on and I cannot wait to make more projects like this. Sustainability is such a relevant and imporant topic to discuss, awareness is key! </p>
