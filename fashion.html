    <h1> review </h1>
    <ul>
      <li> Everyday people buy from businesses that contribute to the pollution of our Earth.</li>
      <li>These global corporations will continue to do this unless we start buying from places that produce their products in an ethical, sustainable manner using eco-friendly materials. </li>
      <li>We can reduce this by recycling, reusing, and not wasting any resources as often as we can</li>
      <li>Thrifting, buying from sustainable shops, donating old clothes are a great way to start! </li>
    </ul>
