        <h5 class="column">Why you should use reFuture.</h5>
        <p class="p-column">Our earth is deteriorating at a faster rate than ever before. In fact, according to <a class="p-text" href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/were-gobbling-earths-resources-unsustainable-rate">unep.org</a>, the extraction and processing of materials, fuels and food (all things YOU consume!) contribute half of total global greenhouse gas emissions and over 90 percent of biodiversity loss and water stress. That's a horrible statistic, if you ask us, and it's only getting worse. Resource extraction has more than tripled since 1970, and by 2060, global material use could double to 190 billion tonnes (from 92 billion). But we can change this.
