		<h2 class = "header2">--> here are a few practices that can be implemented into your daily life</h2>

		<h3 class="header3"> reduce! reuse! recycle! </h3>
    <div class="subtext">
    <p> Waste can negatively impact our environment by producing unwanted gases that may contribute to global warming and climate change. Waste that is not properly recycled can also result in putting lives in danger and contributing to air & water pollution as well. Let’s change that by choosing to reduce, reuse, and recycle!</p>
      <p class="greenwords"> Definitions: </p>
      <p>Reduce: use less </p> 
      <p>Reuse: use again </p>
      <p>Recycle: convert into reusable material </p> 
      <p class="greenwords">What can I do to help? </p>
      <p>Reduce - stop over preparing food </p>
      <p>Reuse - start using reusable bags, give away clothes you don’t wear anymore, reuse products that can be refilled </p>
      <p>Recycle - collect plastic bottles/cans and turn them in to earn money (5-10 cents per can/bottle)</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="header3"> conserve water! </h3>
    <div class="subtext">
    <p> Water is something that should not be wasted. Water is extremely important! Wasting water is considered bad to us and the environment in several ways. It makes water less accessible to us and animals. Wasting water also results in wasting the energy and resources that were used to transport the water. Additionally, we shouldn’t be wasting water generously when there are people out there who NEED water!  </p>
    <p class="greenwords">What can I do to help? </p>
    <p> - take short showers </p>
    <p> - check for leaks </p>
    <p> - check all faucets to make sure they're turned off when not being used </p>
    <p> - use the washing machine for full loads only </p>
    <p> - water your plants when it's cool outside </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="header3"> conserve energy! </h3>
    <div class="subtext">
    <p> Energy usage comes with a price. Our energy is produced by fossil fuels like coal, oil, natural gas, and gasoline. The constant usage of these materials result in polluting the air that we breathe. The amount of energy we use each year increases as time flies by. Conserving energy is extremely important to keeping our earth in good shape.</p>
    <p class="greenwords">What can I do to help? </p>
    <p> - turn off utilities that aren't being used (light switches, tv, showers)</p>
    <p> - switch to using solar power! (renewable energy)</p>
    <p> - don't leave the refrigerator door open!  </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="header3"> public transportation but make it sustainable! </h3>
    <div class="subtext">
    <p> In today’s society, public transportation can’t be avoided. But, you should try walking or biking every once in a while. Vehicles produce a lot of unwanted gases like carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that can dangerously pollute the air. Air pollution isn’t good for the environment, for us, and for animals! </p>
    <p> Fun Fact: Greenhouse gases result in rising temperatures all across the globe </p>
    <p class="greenwords">What can I do to help? </p>
    <p> - walk to your workplace/school </p>
    <p> - use a bike </p>
    <p> - invest in an eco-friendly (fuel-efficient) vehicle </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="header3"> slow fashion > fast fashion </h3>
    <div class="subtext">
    <p> Before you buy anything off the internet, you should consider purchasing anything but fast fashion. Fast fashion uses cheap materials, toxic textile dyes, synthetic materials, and poor agriculture practices. Fast fashion is also the second largest water polluter after agriculture. You should consider trying slow fashion! Slow fashion may be a little more expensive, however slow fashion produces long-lasting, sustainable, and high-quality clothing which makes up for being expensive. Take this into consideration the next time you go shopping! </p>
    <p class="greenwords"> Definitions:</p>
    <p> Slow Fashion: fashion that considers the processes and resources required to make clothing </p>
    <p> Fast Fashion: low-cost designs that are produced at a fast rate with cheap materials </p>
    <p class="greenwords">What can I do to help? </p>
    <p> - go for quality over quantity </p>
    <p> - don't rush the shopping process! </p>
    <p> - take all of your choices into consideration before purchasing </p>
    <p> - be well informed about the materials that were used to produce your clothes </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="header3"> start planting! build a garden! </h3>
    <div class="subtext">
    <p> We’re definitely trying to produce the least amount of gas possible, so you should consider shopping at local markets that you can walk to. Or you can start growing your own vegetables and fruits! This is a healthier alternative to using your vehicle to go grocery shopping, this is a huge contributor to preventing air pollution! </p>
    <p class="greenwords">What can I do to help? </p>
    <p> - shop at local markets </p>
    <p> - plant your own veggies and fruits </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="header3"> start using eco-friendly products! </h3>
    <div class="subtext">
    <p> Eco-friendly products are a huge contributor to keeping our environment healthy and strong. These products do not impose harm to the environment, which is good! Eco-friendly products can be reused and recycled, which makes things more convenient for the rest of us. Overall, eco-friendly products are good for preserving the environment because they reduce pollution and other factors that could have occurred! </p>
    <p class="greenwords">What can I do to help? </p>
    <p> - search up eco-friendly products (toothbrushes, bags, leashes)! it's easy! </p>
    <p> - search for "zero waste" the next time you go shopping </p>
