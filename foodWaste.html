  <h1> the issue </h1>
  <ul>
    <li> We generate 21.5 million tons of food waste each year. </li>
    <li> If we composted that food, it would reduce the same amount of greenhouse gas as taking 2 million cars off the road. </li>
  </ul>
  <h1> the importance of not wasting food </h1>
  <p> what is food waste? </p>
  <ul> 
    <li>Food that is not eaten and gets  thrown away</li>
  </ul>
  <p> why is not wasting food important? </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduces methane emissions from landfills</li>
    <li>Prevents pollution involved in selling food</li>
    <li>Conserves energy and resources</li>
  </ul>
  <h1> how to stop wasting food (compost)</h1>
  <p> What is composting?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The decomposition of organic material ( things that were once living in nature) that can be used as fertilizer. </li>
    <li>Ex: turning old fruits into new fertilizers, in order to grow plants</li>
  </ul>
  <p> How to compost </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use your city's compost systems</li>
    <li>Make your own compost at home with a bin of dirt mixed with twigs and leaves</li>
  </ul>
  <h1> what you can compost </h1>
  <ul>
    <li> Food scraps including egg shells, meat, & bones </li>
    <li> Food-soiled paper, napkins, paper towels, pizza boxes, cardboard egg cartons, non-plastic take out containers, & paper plates </li>
    <li> Coffee grounds, tea bags, & yard waste </li>
    <li> Compostable packaging </li>
  </ul>
  <h1> impacts of saving food & composting </h1>
  <ul>
    <li> No wasted freshwater & groundwater resources </li>
    <li> Reduced production of methane </li>
    <li> Better land usage </li>
    <li> Reduces the need for chemical fertilizers </li>
    <li> Promotes higher yield of crops </li>
    <li> Pulls carbon out of atmosphere </li>
  </ul>
  <h1> review </h1>
  <ul>
    <li>There is a large amount of food waste  created every year </li>
    <li>This is harmful because it wastes natural resources and produces harmful gasses in landfills </li>
    <li>We must prevent it by composting our excess food and making new fertilizer to grow plants </li>
    <li>Ultimately, composting  saves food, while  keeping the environment healthier, and individuals happier </li>
  </ul>
